Life (Version 1.0a)		November 1, 1993

	This is my implementation of the Game of Life. There was a NS2.x Life
program (By Peter Oleski, peter_oleski@hh.maus.de) on the archives but it
didn't do all I wanted to do. Everything here is new except for the computation
algorithm. 
	
	The program is free under the FSF lisence terms (Copyright to me).
	
	You should be able to find a binary only distribution: Life.10.tar.gz 
and a source code distribution: Life.10.src.tar.gz.
	
	I may be reached at gil@atlatnic.mps.ohio-state.edu

Installation:
	From binary
	-----------
	Simply drag the extracted binary version to ~/Apps or /LocalApps. Logout
and login to let Workspace Manager know about the new file type.
	
	From source
	-----------
	Open the source in Project Builder and change the default 'Install In' 
directory in the Attributes view. (The current default is $(HOME)/Apps).
	In the builder view, use the pop-up menu to choose install, and click
build.
